Source Code: lexical-analyser.py
This is a python script, so it is not required to build it any more.

Hence, I added only exec.sh file.


Execution guideline:
======================

1) Executing following command should execute the script and take the input file from given path.

 ./exec.sh <input_file>		

For example, ./exec.sh ../badbool.frag 
As there is no specific output file path given, the output will be printed on the terminal (standard output stream).



2) To provide a output file to write the outputs, execute following command - 

 ./exec.sh <input_file> <output_file> 

For example, ./exec.sh ../badbool.frag ../badbool.out
